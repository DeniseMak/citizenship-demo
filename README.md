# Citizenship test tutor

There has been a need for better resources to help immigrants prepare for the US naturalization interview and test, described here: https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/the-naturalization-interview-and-test. Sometimes they can find human volunteers at places like community centers to help them practice taking the test. But often these classes and tutoring sessions are in short supply or inconvenient for the prospective test-takers. A chatbot that quizzes test-takers with sample questions can help fill the gap.

* This repo contains a demo of the Cortana skill for the citizenship test that can be run locally while the deployed skill is under development.
